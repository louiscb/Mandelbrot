# Mandelbrot Image Creator

This program creates an image of a Mandelbrot fractural set. 

The [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) is the set of complex numbers for which a function does not diverge when iterated from.
 
## How to run

Compile the file `c("Mandel.ex")`

Run the function `Mandel.demo`

It will generate a new image called `new.ppm`

To change the generation of the image, change the values of the variables in Mandel.demo and Mandel.small
